# An algorithm that I spun up to fix my box shadow pixel art

I made the mistake of drawing pixel art with a [css generator](https://www.pixelartcss.com/), now I face the cosequences of my actions.

I just finished drawing Ms Muffet from UnderTale using the box shadow property, and `position: absolute in CSS`, when I realized she was too far to the right.

When I attempted to use the left and right property to scoot her more to the left, I realized the div was already hitting the end of the webpage.

I realized I was doomed to redraw Ms. Muffet, or manually change 300 lines of pixel values in my code. So, I converted all the RBGA values to a string and created an algorithm so I could move Ms. Muffet without having to move the div.

I used [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) to remove the white space from css formatting.

Here is Ms-Muffet!
